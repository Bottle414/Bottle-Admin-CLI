# 🌟 Bottle-Admin-CLI

Bottle-Admin-CLI is a fast and beginner-friendly admin system scaffold designed to quickly build admin dashboards with minimal configuration.

It is built with Vue 3, using Vite as the bundler, Axios for request handling, and Vue Router for routing. Optional support for Vue-i18n for internationalization, basic ECharts like line/pie charts, and commit pipeline integration are included.

**Currently, only the TypeScript version is available.**
